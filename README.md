# WordPress Work Custom Post Type

This is a plugin that adds a Work custom post type that allows you display your recent portfolio of work.

**What's included**

With the Guerrilla's Work CPT plugin, the Work CPT gets created with the following options for each portfolio piece you add.

- Title and description
- A category selector for the type of work (ie: *Web Design*)
- Featured image
- A Work Industry section with industry, year and website URL options

The three *theme template files* required are also included so you can customize as you see fit.

And there is a style.css file for you to change the design of the code as you see fit.

### How to add the template files to your theme

Copy the three files from the plugin folder's *templates* folder and put them into your current themes folder. 

### Theme support

Currently, the [Clarirty](http://www.inspiiired.com/clarity-wordpress-theme) WordPress theme is the first to adopt this plugin so it will work perfect right out of the box. *see screenshots*

As more theme authors adopt this plugin for their themes, I will add them here.
